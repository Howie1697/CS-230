Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Analying the differences between Linux, Windows and Apple based servers.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
